## ðŸ‘‹ About

Welcome! Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University.  
My background spans civil engineering, academic support, and project administration across energy, education, and tech sectors.

With over 10 years of professional experience, Iâ€™ve worked on large-scale engineering projects, supported academic programs at Nazarbayev University, and most recently led digital transformation efforts in Kazakhstanâ€™s oil & gas and IT industries.

I'm passionate about leveraging analytics and process improvement for impact-driven results â€” and believe in lifelong learning, curiosity, and collaboration.
